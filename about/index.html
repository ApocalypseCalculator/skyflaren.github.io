				<h2>Nicole Cui</h2>
				<p>As we all know, our school mascot is not a living lion but rather a student in a fursuit. Although I’ll be unable to get us a real lion, I can get us a real leader ;). My name is Nicole Cui, and I'm running to be your Vice-President for the 2021-2022 Student Council. Since becoming a part of the WLMAC community almost two years ago, I’ve been involved in a plethora of clubs such as HOSA, DECA, MCPT, and more. After clubs have gone virtual, I continue to actively participate in multiple online activities.  I was elected as Valedictorian for the graduating class of 2019, and I have plenty of experience from my previous school’s Student Council. As a member for two years and President for the last, I had the opportunity to hold initiatives and represent the council on multiple occasions, including school performances and community events. My past experiences have molded me into a well-fitted individual for this position. At the same time, I know exactly what it is like being a student at Mackenzie. As Vice-President, I will see through fulfilling all feasible initiatives, and help to manage school clubs. Ultimately, should you elect me, you’ll find a dedicated VP in SAC, and maybe even a lion prowling the hallways. </p>
